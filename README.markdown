Rabbit Reminder
===============

A simple geolocalized to-do list application for _Google Android_.

Build Rabbit Reminder
---------------------

###Build the application with _Eclipse_

Open a new _Eclipse_ workspace and click _File > Import > General > Existing project into workspace_. Then in the _Select root directory_ field, write the path to the _Rabbit Reminder_ folder.

Do the same thing for the _Rabbit Reminder Test_ folder if you want to build the unit & functional tests.

The workspace should be built automatically by _Eclipse_: if not, click _Project > Build All_.

**If it don't build correctly**

- Check that projects are synchronized with Eclipse by selecting them and pressing _F5_
- Check that projects properties are correct by _right clicking_ on them and choose _Android Tools > Fix Project Properties_
- Suppress generated classes as the _R.java_ class and rebuild the whole project.

### Build the application with _Ant_

_TODO_
